# ci-status.sh — wait for a run's CI to settle, then print one verdict: GREEN, RED or PENDING.
# Seeded from the estate pipeline template (icm-board _system/template/icm-pipeline/scripts/),
# with one repo-specific rule added — see "Pipeline gates" below.
#
# The PIPELINE_REQUIRED_CHECKS parse below splits on NEWLINES ONLY. That is a template fix
# landed here first (.icm/intake/triage/icm-template-required-checks-newline.md tracks the port
# upstream): commas are legal inside a GitHub check-run name — this repo's own blocking check is
# named "Format, lint, typecheck" — so comma-splitting cannot express the very names the variable
# exists to hold, and would silently invent phantom required checks that never register.
#
# The deterministic answer to "is this PR green?" (.icm/_shared/ci.md). It reads BOTH
# surfaces a commit's health lives on — GitHub Actions check runs AND commit statuses
# (deploy providers land there) — discards the known noise, and blocks until the run
# settles, so a stage can genuinely wait without spending model turns on a
# sleep-and-re-read loop. Requires curl + jq.
#
# What it filters, and why (rationale in .icm/_shared/ci.md):
#   * "Vercel Preview Comments" is a zero-second always-success marker — ignored.
#   * "Pipeline gates" (.github/workflows/gates.yaml) is a projection of the PR body's gate
#     checkboxes, not of the factory: it is RED by design for the whole of Build, because
#     "Ready to merge" is not ticked until the owner has tested the change. It carries no
#     information about whether anything compiled, so it is ignored here for exactly the
#     reason the Vercel marker is. The gate itself is never skipped — the stage contracts
#     read the checkbox out of the PR body directly, and branch protection requires this
#     same check green before the merge. Reading it here as a factory verdict would mean
#     Build could never hand off.
#   * A status reading "Canceled by Ignored Build Step" is a SKIPPED deploy, not a pass.
#   * Check runs whose name ends "(advisory)" are reported but never make the verdict RED.
#   * A required check that has not appeared yet is PENDING, never GREEN. With no
#     required checks configured, ZERO signals on the head is also PENDING — an empty
#     check list on a fresh push is CI not having started, not CI having passed.
#
# Config from the process environment (no .env loading):
#   GITHUB_TOKEN / GH_TOKEN     (one required)
#   GITHUB_REPO                 (optional)  owner/repo; default: derived from `origin`.
#   GITHUB_API_URL              (optional)  API base. Default: https://api.github.com.
#   PIPELINE_REQUIRED_CHECKS    (optional)  Newline-separated check-run names that must be
#                                           present and completed before GREEN. Newlines only —
#                                           a check name may itself contain a comma. Set this to
#                                           the repo's own blocking CI check names.
#
# Usage:
#   .icm/scripts/ci-status.sh <slug> [--timeout <seconds>] [--interval <seconds>] [--no-wait]
#   .icm/scripts/ci-status.sh --pr <number> [...]
#
# Verdict (stdout, last line):
#   RESULT: GREEN    exit 0  — every blocking check and status completed, none failed.
#   RESULT: RED      exit 3  — something blocking failed. STOP: read logs, fix, push, re-run.
#   RESULT: PENDING  exit 4  — unsettled (or required checks never registered). Not a pass.
